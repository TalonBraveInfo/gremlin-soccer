 > Original initialisation code is INCREDIBLY messy, game vars should be initialised somewhere else!
 > The game compiles down as C++ but is written stylistically as C; I'll retain this in refactoring
 > Everything starts from test.cpp which contains the init loop etc etc
 > Config parser is missing, bummer but it's just an ini file so it's not a huge issue parsing it
 > Further config stuff is missing? Saved states etc?? Hrrmm I'm yet to see this anywhere...
